# Document Fraud Simulation Lab

Transform genuine documents into realistic training datasets for fraud detection models.

## 🌐 Live Demo

**Access the app**: https://fraud-simulation-lab-oh5cd5tqtndgsnruxro3jr.streamlit.app/ (but it's a more Basic feature set)

## 🎯 Features

- **Document Distortion**: 5 realistic fraud simulation presets
- **ML Training Ready**: Generate labeled datasets with metadata
- **Instant Access**: No installation required
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any device with a web browser

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Upload a clean document image (PNG, JPEG, TIFF)
2. Choose a distortion type (aging, scanning artifacts, physical damage, etc.)
3. Set the number of training samples
4. Generate and download your fraud simulation dataset

## 🔧 Local Development

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## 📊 Use Cases

- Document fraud detection model training
- OCR robustness testing
- Image preprocessing algorithm development
- Authentication system training data
